## Installation ðŸ“¥

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   ttps://github.com/Anveshapal/Website-blocker-.git
  
## Notes 

This tool modifies the Windows hosts file to block websites. Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
If you face issues, manually check the hosts file at:
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

If you need to unblock websites manually, open the hosts file and remove any lines added by the script.
